TRINCULO.
Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am
Trinculo—be not afeared—thy good friend Trinculo.

STEPHANO.
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth. I'll pull thee by the lesser legs:
if any be Trinculo's legs, these are they. Thou art very Trinculo
indeed! How cam'st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? Can he vent
Trinculos?

TRINCULO.
I took him to be kill'd with a thunderstroke. But art thou not drown'd,
Stephano? I hope now thou are not drown'd. Is the storm overblown? I
hid me under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of the storm. And
art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scap'd!

STEPHANO.
