ARIEL.
Thou liest. Thou canst not.

CALIBAN.
What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.

STEPHANO.
Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word
further, and by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors, and make a
stock-fish of thee.

TRINCULO.
Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther off.

STEPHANO.
Didst thou not say he lied?

ARIEL.
Thou liest.

STEPHANO.
Do I so? Take thou that.

 [_Strikes Trinculo._]

As you like this, give me the lie another time.
