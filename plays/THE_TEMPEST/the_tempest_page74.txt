very weak monster. The Man i' the Moon! A most poor credulous monster!
Well drawn, monster, in good sooth!

CALIBAN.
I'll show thee every fertile inch o' the island; and I will kiss thy
foot. I prithee, be my god.

TRINCULO.
By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster. When 's god's
asleep, he'll rob his bottle.

CALIBAN.
I'll kiss thy foot. I'll swear myself thy subject.

STEPHANO.
Come on, then; down, and swear.

TRINCULO.
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster. A most
scurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him,—

STEPHANO.
Come, kiss.

TRINCULO.
But that the poor monster's in drink. An abominable monster!
