Was the first man that leapt; cried “Hell is empty,
And all the devils are here.”

PROSPERO.
Why, that's my spirit!

ARIEL.
Close by, my master.

PROSPERO.

ARIEL.
Not a hair perish'd;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as thou bad'st me,
In troops I have dispers'd them 'bout the isle.
The King's son have I landed by himself,
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO.
Of the King's ship
The mariners, say how thou hast dispos'd,
And all the rest o' th' fleet?

ARIEL.
Safely in harbour
