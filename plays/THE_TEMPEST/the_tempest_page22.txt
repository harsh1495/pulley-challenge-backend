Is the King's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes; there she's hid:
The mariners all under hatches stowed;
Who, with a charm join'd to their suff'red labour,
I have left asleep: and for the rest o' th' fleet,
Which I dispers'd, they all have met again,
And are upon the Mediterranean flote
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the King's ship wrack'd,
And his great person perish.

PROSPERO.
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd; but there's more work.
What is the time o' th' day?

ARIEL.
Past the mid season.

PROSPERO.
