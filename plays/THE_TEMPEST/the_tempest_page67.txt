will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.

 Enter Stephano singing; a bottle in his hand.

STEPHANO.
_I shall no more to sea, to sea,
Here shall I die ashore—_

This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral.
Well, here's my comfort.

 [_Drinks._]

_The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,
    The gunner, and his mate,
Lov'd Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,
    But none of us car'd for Kate:
    For she had a tongue with a tang,
    Would cry to a sailor “Go hang!”
She lov'd not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch.
    Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang._

This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.
