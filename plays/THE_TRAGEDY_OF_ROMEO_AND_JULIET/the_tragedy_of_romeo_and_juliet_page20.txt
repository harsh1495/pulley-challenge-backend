And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by th'rood
She could have run and waddled all about;

'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay'.
To see now how a jest shall come about.
I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET.

To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay';
And yet I warrant it had upon it brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
