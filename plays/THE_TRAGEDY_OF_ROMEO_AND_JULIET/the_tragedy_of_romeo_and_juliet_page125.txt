PETER.
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease', O, and you
will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Why 'Heart's ease'?

PETER.
O musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is full'. O play
me some merry dump to comfort me.

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Not a dump we, 'tis no time to play now.

PETER.
You will not then?

FIRST MUSICIAN.
No.

PETER.
I will then give it you soundly.

FIRST MUSICIAN.
What will you give us?

PETER.
No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Then will I give you the serving-creature.

PETER.
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate. I will
carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you note me?

FIRST MUSICIAN.
And you re us and fa us, you note us.

SECOND MUSICIAN.
Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

PETER.
Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and
put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
