What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;

Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for thy name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.

Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIET.
What man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night

Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.
