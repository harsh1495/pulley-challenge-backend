    'When griping griefs the heart doth wound,
      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Then music with her silver sound'—
Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'? What say you,
Simon Catling?

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

PETER.
Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

SECOND MUSICIAN.
I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.

PETER.
Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?

THIRD MUSICIAN.
Faith, I know not what to say.

PETER.
O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is
'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no gold for
sounding.
      'Then music with her silver sound
      With speedy help doth lend redress.'

 [_Exit._]

FIRST MUSICIAN.
What a pestilent knave is this same!

SECOND MUSICIAN.
Hang him, Jack. Come, we'll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay
dinner.

 [_Exeunt._]
