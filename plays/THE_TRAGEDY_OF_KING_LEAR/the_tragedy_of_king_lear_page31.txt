     Their manners are so apish.

LEAR.
When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?

FOOL.
I have used it, nuncle, e'er since thou mad'st thy daughters thy
mothers; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st down thine own
breeches,
[_Singing._]
   Then they for sudden joy did weep,
     And I for sorrow sung,
   That such a king should play bo-peep,
     And go the fools among.
Prythee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie; I
would fain learn to lie.

LEAR.
An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.

FOOL.
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are: they'll have me whipped
for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I
am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind o'thing than
a fool: and yet I would not be thee, nuncle: thou hast pared thy wit
o'both sides, and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o' the
parings.

 Enter Goneril.

LEAR.
How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you are too
much of late i' the frown.
