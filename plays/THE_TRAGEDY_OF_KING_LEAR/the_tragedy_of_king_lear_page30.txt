     Will presently appear;
   The one in motley here,
     The other found out there.

LEAR.
Dost thou call me fool, boy?

FOOL.
All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born with.

KENT.
This is not altogether fool, my lord.

FOOL.
No, faith; lords and great men will not let me; if I had a monopoly
out, they would have part on’t and ladies too, they will not let me
have all the fool to myself; they’ll be snatching. Nuncle, give me an
egg, and I’ll give thee two crowns.

LEAR.
What two crowns shall they be?

FOOL.
Why, after I have cut the egg i’ the middle and eat up the meat, the
two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i’ the middle and
gav’st away both parts, thou bor’st thine ass on thy back o’er the
dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gav’st thy
golden one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped
that first finds it so.
[_Singing._]
   Fools had ne’er less grace in a year;
     For wise men are grown foppish,
   And know not how their wits to wear,
