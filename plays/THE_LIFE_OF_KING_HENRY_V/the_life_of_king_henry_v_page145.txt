FRENCH KING.

KING HENRY.

EXETER.
Only he hath not yet subscribed this: where your Majesty demands, that
the King of France, having any occasion to write for matter of grant,
shall name your Highness in this form and with this addition, in
French, _Notre très-cher fils Henri, Roi d'Angleterre, Héritier de

rex Angliae et haeres Franciae._

FRENCH KING.

And thereupon give me your daughter.
