I shall have my noble?

PISTOL.
In cash most justly paid.

NYM.
Well, then, that's the humour of't.

 Enter Hostess.

HOSTESS.
As ever you come of women, come in quickly to Sir John.
Ah, poor heart! he is so shak'd of a burning quotidian tertian,

His heart is fracted and corroborate.

PISTOL.
Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins, we will live.

How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
