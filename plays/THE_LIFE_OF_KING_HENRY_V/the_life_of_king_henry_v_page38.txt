BARDOLPH.
Well, the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire. That's all the riches

NYM.
Shall we shog? The King will be gone from Southampton.

PISTOL.
Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
Look to my chattels and my movables.
Let senses rule; the word is “Pitch and Pay.”
Trust none;
For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes
And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck;
Therefore, _Caveto_ be thy counsellor.
Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,
Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,
To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!

BOY.
And that's but unwholesome food, they say.

PISTOL.

BARDOLPH.
Farewell, hostess.

 [_Kissing her._]

NYM.

PISTOL.
Let housewifery appear. Keep close, I thee command.

HOSTESS.
Farewell; adieu.

 [_Exeunt._]
