KING HENRY.
How canst thou make me satisfaction?

Highness suffer'd under that shape, I beseech you take it for your own
fault and not mine; for had you been as I took you for, I made no

And wear it for an honour in thy cap
Till I do challenge it. Give him his crowns;
And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.

FLUELLEN.

Hold, there is twelve pence for you; and I pray you to serve God, and
keep you out of prawls, and prabbles, and quarrels, and dissensions,
