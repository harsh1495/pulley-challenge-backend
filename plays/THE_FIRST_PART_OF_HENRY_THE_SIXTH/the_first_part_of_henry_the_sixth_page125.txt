  YORK. Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake.

          Alarum. Enter SUFFOLK, with MARGARET in his hand

  SUFFOLK. Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.
                                                  [Gazes on her]

    I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,
    And lay them gently on thy tender side.
