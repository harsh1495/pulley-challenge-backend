    Come, sister-cousin, I would say-pray, pardon me.

    And bring away the armour that is there.

    Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
    If I know how or which way to order these affairs
    Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,
    Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen.
    T'one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
    And duty bids defend; t'other again
    Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong'd,
    Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.

    I'll dispose of you. Gentlemen, go muster up your men
    And meet me presently at Berkeley.

    And everything is left at six and seven.
