    But dust was thrown upon his sacred head;
    Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,

    Whose state and honour I for aye allow.

  YORK. Aumerle that was
    But that is lost for being Richard's friend,

    And lasting fealty to the new-made king.

                  Enter AUMERLE

  DUCHESS. Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now
    That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
