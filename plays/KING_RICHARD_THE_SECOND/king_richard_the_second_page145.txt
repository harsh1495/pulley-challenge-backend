  BOLINGBROKE. We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
    And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

                  Enter FITZWATER

    That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.
  BOLINGBROKE. Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;
    Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.

         Enter PERCY, With the BISHOP OF CARLISLE

    With clog of conscience and sour melancholy,

  BOLINGBROKE. Carlisle, this is your doom:
    Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,

    So as thou liv'st in peace, die free from strife;
