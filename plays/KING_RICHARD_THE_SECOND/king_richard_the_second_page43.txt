  YORK. How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long
    Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
    Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment,
    Nor Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,

    Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.

    Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.

    In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
