    Rich men look sad, and ruffians dance and leap-
    The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,

    The sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
    Witnessing storms to come, woe, and unrest;
    Thy friends are fled, to wait upon thy foes;
    And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.               Exit
