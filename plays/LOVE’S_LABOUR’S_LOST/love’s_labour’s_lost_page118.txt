    Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
  ROSALINE. This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-
  BEROWNE. I am a fool, and full of poverty.

  ROSALINE. All the fool mine?
  BEROWNE. I cannot give you less.

  BEROWNE. Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this?
  ROSALINE. There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
    That hid the worse and show'd the better face.

  ROSALINE. Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
