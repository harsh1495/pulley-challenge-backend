                        in their proper habits

  KING. Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princess?
  BOYET. Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty
    Command me any service to her thither?
  KING. That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.

    At wakes, and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
    And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
