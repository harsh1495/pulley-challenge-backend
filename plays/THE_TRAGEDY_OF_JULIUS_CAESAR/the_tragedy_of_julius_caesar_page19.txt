stinking breath because Caesar refus'd the crown, that it had, almost,
choked Caesar, for he swooned, and fell down at it. And for mine own
part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the
bad air.

CASSIUS.

CASCA.
He fell down in the market-place, and foam'd at mouth, and was
speechless.

CASSIUS.
