ACT II

SCENE I. Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.

Enter Katherina and Bianca.

BIANCA.
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain; but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.

KATHERINA.
Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
Whom thou lov'st best: see thou dissemble not.

BIANCA.

I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.

KATHERINA.
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?

BIANCA.
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him.

KATHERINA.
