BAPTISTA.
Son, I’ll be your half, Bianca comes.

LUCENTIO.

Re-enter Biondello.

How now! what news?

BIONDELLO.
Sir, my mistress sends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come.

PETRUCHIO.

GREMIO.

PETRUCHIO.
I hope better.

HORTENSIO.
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.

[_Exit Biondello._]

PETRUCHIO.

Nay, then she must needs come.

HORTENSIO.

Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.


Re-enter Biondello.

BIONDELLO.

PETRUCHIO.
