Steep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers
Unmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrain,
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make’s love known?

LADY MACBETH.
Help me hence, ho!

MACDUFF.
Look to the lady.

Hid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?

Upon the foot of motion.

BANQUO.
Look to the lady:—

And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
