LADY MACBETH.
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you
yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out on's grave.

DOCTOR.
Even so?

LADY MACBETH.
To bed, to bed. There's knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come,
give me your hand. What's done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to
bed.

 [_Exit._]

DOCTOR.
Will she go now to bed?

GENTLEWOMAN.
Directly.

DOCTOR.
Foul whisp'rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
More needs she the divine than the physician.—
God, God, forgive us all! Look after her;
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
