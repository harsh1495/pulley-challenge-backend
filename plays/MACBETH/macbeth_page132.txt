And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo,

Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

Profit again should hardly draw me here.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE IV. Country near Dunsinane: a Wood in view.

 Enter, with drum and colours Malcolm, old Siward and his Son, Macduff,
 Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross and Soldiers, marching.
