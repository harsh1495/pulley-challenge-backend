 Thunder. Enter the three Witches.

FIRST WITCH.
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.

SECOND WITCH.
Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whin'd.

THIRD WITCH.
Harpier cries:—'Tis time, 'tis time.

FIRST WITCH.
Round about the cauldron go;
In the poison'd entrails throw.—
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i' th' charmed pot!

ALL.
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.

SECOND WITCH.
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt, and toe of frog,
Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting,
Lizard's leg, and howlet's wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
