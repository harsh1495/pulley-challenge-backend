PAROLLES.
Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more,
But I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft
As captain shall. Simply the thing I am
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
Let him fear this; for it will come to pass
That every braggart shall be found an ass.
Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles live
Safest in shame; being fool'd, by foolery thrive.
There's place and means for every man alive.
I'll after them.

SCENE IV. Florence. A room in the Widow's house.

 Enter Helena, Widow and Diana.

HELENA.
That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you
One of the greatest in the Christian world
Shall be my surety; fore whose throne 'tis needful,
Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.
Time was I did him a desired office,
Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
