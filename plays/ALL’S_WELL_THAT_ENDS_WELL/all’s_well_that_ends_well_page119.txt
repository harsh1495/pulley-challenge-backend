Something in my behalf.

DIANA.
Let death and honesty
Go with your impositions, I am yours
Upon your will to suffer.

HELENA.

But with the word the time will bring on summer,
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us.
All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown.
Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.

 [_Exeunt._]

 Enter Clown, Countess and Lafew.

LAFEW.

this hour, and your son here at home, more advanc'd by the king than by
that red-tail'd humble-bee I speak of.

COUNTESS.
I would I had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous
