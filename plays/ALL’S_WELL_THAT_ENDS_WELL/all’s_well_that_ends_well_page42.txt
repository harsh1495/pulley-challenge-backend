courtier; it shall do you no harm to learn.

COUNTESS.
To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in question, hoping to
be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

CLOWN.
O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of
them.

COUNTESS.
Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.

CLOWN.
O Lord, sir! Thick, thick; spare not me.

COUNTESS.
I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

CLOWN.
O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.

COUNTESS.
You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.

CLOWN.
O Lord, sir! Spare not me.

COUNTESS.
Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare not me'? Indeed
your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your whipping. You would answer
very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

CLOWN.
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see things may
serve long, but not serve ever.
