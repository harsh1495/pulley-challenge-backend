      one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall
      be, that痴 certain; wise, or I値l none; virtuous, or I値l never
      cheapen her; fair, or I値l never look on her; mild, or come not
      near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an
      excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it
      please God. Ha! the Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in
      the arbour.


      [_Withdraws._]


      Enter Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio, followed by Balthasar and
      Musicians.


      DON PEDRO.
      Come, shall we hear this music?


      CLAUDIO.
      Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
      As hush壇 on purpose to grace harmony!


      DON PEDRO.
      See you where Benedick hath hid himself?


      CLAUDIO.
      O! very well, my lord: the music ended,
      We値l fit the kid-fox with a penny-worth.


      DON PEDRO.
      Come, Balthasar, we値l hear that song again.
