      one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall
      be, that's certain; wise, or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never
      cheapen her; fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not
      near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an
      excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it
      please God. Ha! the Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in
      the arbour.


      [_Withdraws._]


      Enter Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio, followed by Balthasar and
      Musicians.


      DON PEDRO.
      Come, shall we hear this music?


      CLAUDIO.
      Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
      As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!


      DON PEDRO.
      See you where Benedick hath hid himself?


      CLAUDIO.
      O! very well, my lord: the music ended,
      We'll fit the kid-fox with a penny-worth.


      DON PEDRO.
      Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
