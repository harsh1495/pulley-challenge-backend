      But not for that dream I on this strange course,
      But on this travail look for greater birth.
      She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,
      Upon the instant that she was accus'd,
      Shall be lamented, pitied and excus'd
      Of every hearer; for it so falls out
      That what we have we prize not to the worth
      Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
      Why, then we rack the value, then we find
      The virtue that possession would not show us
      Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
      When he shall hear she died upon his words,
      The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
      Into his study of imagination,
      And every lovely organ of her life
      Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
      More moving, delicate, and full of life
      Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
      Than when she liv'd indeed: then shall he mourn,—
      If ever love had interest in his liver,—
