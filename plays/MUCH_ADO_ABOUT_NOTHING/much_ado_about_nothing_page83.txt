Scene IV. A Room in Leonato's House.

      Enter Hero, Margaret and Ursula.


      HERO.
      Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire her to rise.


      URSULA.
      I will, lady.


      HERO.
      And bid her come hither.


      URSULA.
      Well.


      [_Exit._]


      MARGARET.
      Troth, I think your other rebato were better.


      HERO.
      No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.


      MARGARET.
      By my troth's not so good; and I warrant your cousin will say so.


      HERO.
      My cousin 's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear none but
      this.


      MARGARET.
      I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a
      thought browner; and your gown 's a most rare fashion, i' faith.
      I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so.


      HERO.
      O! that exceeds, they say.
