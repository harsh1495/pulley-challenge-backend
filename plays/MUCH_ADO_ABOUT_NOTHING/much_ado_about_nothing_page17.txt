      And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
      That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?


      CLAUDIO.
      How sweetly you do minister to love,
      That know love's grief by his complexion!
      But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
      I would have salv'd it with a longer treatise.


      DON PEDRO.
      What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
      The fairest grant is the necessity.
      Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lov'st,
      And I will fit thee with the remedy.
      I know we shall have revelling tonight:
      I will assume thy part in some disguise,
      And tell fair Hero I am Claudio;
      And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart,
      And take her hearing prisoner with the force
      And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
      Then after to her father will I break;
      And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
      In practice let us put it presently.


      [_Exeunt._]
