      CLAUDIO.
      Why then, she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.


      LEONATO.
      No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
      Before this friar, and swear to marry her.


      CLAUDIO.
      Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
      I am your husband, if you like of me.


      HERO.
      And when I liv'd, I was your other wife:
      [_Unmasking._] And when you lov'd, you were my other husband.


      CLAUDIO.
      Another Hero!


      HERO.
      Nothing certainer:
      One Hero died defil'd, but I do live,
      And surely as I live, I am a maid.


      DON PEDRO.
      The former Hero! Hero that is dead!


      LEONATO.
      She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv'd.


      FRIAR.
      All this amazement can I qualify:
      When after that the holy rites are ended,
      I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:
      Meantime, let wonder seem familiar,
      And to the chapel let us presently.
