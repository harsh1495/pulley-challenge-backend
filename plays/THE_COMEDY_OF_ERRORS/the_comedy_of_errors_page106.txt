He came to me, and I deliver’d it.

LUCIANA.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
God and the rope-maker bear me witness
That I was sent for nothing but a rope.

Mistress, both man and master is possess’d,

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?

ADRIANA.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS.
And gentle master, I receiv’d no gold;
But I confess, sir, that we were lock’d out.
