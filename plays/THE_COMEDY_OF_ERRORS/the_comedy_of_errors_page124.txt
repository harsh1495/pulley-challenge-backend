And with his mad attendant and himself,
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
Met us again, and, madly bent on us,
Chased us away; till raising of more aid,

And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.

Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
