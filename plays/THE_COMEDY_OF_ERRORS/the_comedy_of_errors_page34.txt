DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
I’ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
In good time, sir, what’s that?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
