If he be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?

 Enter Luciana.

ADRIANA.
Go, Dromio, there’s the money, bear it straight,
And bring thy master home immediately.

Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

SCENE III. The same.

 Enter Antipholus of Syracuse.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.
There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me

And everyone doth call me by my name.
Some tender money to me, some invite me;
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
