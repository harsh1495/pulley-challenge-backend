me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch.

I will not stay tonight for all the town;
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

ACT V

SCENE I. The same.

 Enter Merchant and Angelo.

ANGELO.
I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you,
But I protest he had the chain of me,
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

MERCHANT.
How is the man esteem'd here in the city?

ANGELO.
Of very reverend reputation, sir,
Of credit infinite, highly belov'd,
Second to none that lives here in the city.
His word might bear my wealth at any time.
