the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.

 A sennet sounded. Enter Caesar, Antony, Pompey, Lepidus, Agrippa,
 Maecenas, Enobarbus, Menas with other Captains.

ANTONY.

By certain scales i’ th’ pyramid; they know

Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
And shortly comes to harvest.

ANTONY.

POMPEY.
Sit, and some wine! A health to Lepidus!

LEPIDUS.

ENOBARBUS.
