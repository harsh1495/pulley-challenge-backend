A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.

POSTHUMUS.
Nay, do not wonder at it; you are made
Rather to wonder at the things you hear
Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,
And vent it for a mock'ry? Here is one:


        'Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,
        Preserv'd the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'

LORD.
Nay, be not angry, sir.

POSTHUMUS.
'Lack, to what end?
Who dares not stand his foe I'll be his friend;
For if he'll do as he is made to do,
I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
You have put me into rhyme.

LORD.
Farewell; you're angry.

 [_Exit._]

POSTHUMUS.
Still going? This is a lord! O noble misery,
To be i' th' field and ask 'What news?' of me!
Today how many would have given their honours
To have sav'd their carcasses! took heel to do't,
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
Nor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly monster,
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
Sweet words; or hath moe ministers than we
That draw his knives i' th' war. Well, I will find him;
