    Golden lads and girls all must,
    As chimney-sweepers, come to dust._

ARVIRAGUS.
_    Fear no more the frown o’ th’ great;
        Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke.
    Care no more to clothe and eat;
        To thee the reed is as the oak.
    The sceptre, learning, physic, must
    All follow this and come to dust._

GUIDERIUS.
_    Fear no more the lightning flash._

ARVIRAGUS.
_        Nor th’ all-dreaded thunder-stone._

GUIDERIUS.
_    Fear not slander, censure rash;_

ARVIRAGUS.
_    Thou hast finish’d joy and moan._

BOTH.
_    All lovers young, all lovers must
    Consign to thee and come to dust._

GUIDERIUS.
_    No exorciser harm thee!_

ARVIRAGUS.
_    Nor no witchcraft charm thee!_

GUIDERIUS.
_    Ghost unlaid forbear thee!_

ARVIRAGUS.
_    Nothing ill come near thee!_

BOTH.
_    Quiet consummation have,
    And renowned be thy grave!_
