In my respect, than all the hairs above thee,
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!

 Enter Pisanio.

CLOTEN.
'His garment'! Now the devil—

IMOGEN.
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently.

CLOTEN.
'His garment'!

IMOGEN.
I am sprited with a fool;
Frighted, and ang'red worse. Go bid my woman
Search for a jewel that too casually
Hath left mine arm. It was thy master's; shrew me,
If I would lose it for a revenue
Of any king's in Europe! I do think
I saw't this morning; confident I am
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it.
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he.

PISANIO.
'Twill not be lost.

IMOGEN.
I hope so. Go and search.

 [_Exit Pisanio._]

CLOTEN.
You have abus'd me.
'His meanest garment'!

IMOGEN.
Ay, I said so, sir.
If you will make 't an action, call witness to 't.

CLOTEN.
I will inform your father.

IMOGEN.
Your mother too.
She's my good lady and will conceive, I hope,
But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir,
To th' worst of discontent.

 [_Exit._]

CLOTEN.
I'll be reveng'd.
'His mean'st garment'! Well.
