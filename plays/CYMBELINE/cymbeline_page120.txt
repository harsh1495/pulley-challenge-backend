Thou orphans' father art,
Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
From this earth-vexing smart.

But took me in my throes,
That from me was Posthumus ripp'd,
Came crying 'mongst his foes,
A thing of pity.

SICILIUS.

Moulded the stuff so fair
That he deserv'd the praise o' th' world
As great Sicilius' heir.

FIRST BROTHER.

Our parents and us twain,
That, striking in our country's cause,
Fell bravely and were slain,
