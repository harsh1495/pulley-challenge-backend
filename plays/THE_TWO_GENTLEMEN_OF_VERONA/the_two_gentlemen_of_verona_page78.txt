        Because myself do want my servants' fortune.

    What's here?
      'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'

    And with thy daring folly burn the world?

    Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates;
    And think my patience, more than thy desert,
    Is privilege for thy departure hence.
