    When to her beauty I commend my vows,
    She bids me think how I have been forsworn

    The more it grows and fawneth on her still.

  THURIO. How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
  PROTEUS. Ay, gentle Thurio; for you know that love
    Will creep in service where it cannot go.
  THURIO. Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
