  JULIA. From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
  SILVIA. O, he sends you for a picture?

  SILVIA. Ursula, bring my picture there.

    Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
  JULIA. Madam, please you peruse this letter.

  SILVIA. I pray thee let me look on that again.
  JULIA. It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
  SILVIA. There, hold!
    I will not look upon your master's lines.

    And full of new-found oaths, which he wul break
