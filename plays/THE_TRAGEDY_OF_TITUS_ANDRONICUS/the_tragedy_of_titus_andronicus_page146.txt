  LUCIUS. Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;

    I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
    I should repent the evils I have done;

    If one good deed in all my life I did,
    I do repent it from my very soul.
  LUCIUS. Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,
    And give him burial in his father's grave.
    My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
    Be closed in our household's monument.
