ULYSSES.
[_Aside_.] Wit would be out of fashion.

AJAX.
A' should not bear it so, a' should eat's words first.
Shall pride carry it?

NESTOR.
[_Aside_.] And 'twould, you'd carry half.

ULYSSES.
[_Aside_.] A' would have ten shares.

AJAX.
I will knead him, I'll make him supple.

NESTOR.
[_Aside_.] He's not yet through warm. Force him with praises; pour in,
pour in; his ambition is dry.

ULYSSES.
[_To Agamemnon_.] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.

NESTOR.
Our noble general, do not do so.

DIOMEDES.
You must prepare to fight without Achilles.

ULYSSES.
Why 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
Here is a man—but 'tis before his face;
I will be silent.

NESTOR.
Wherefore should you so?
He is not emulous, as Achilles is.

ULYSSES.
Know the whole world, he is as valiant.

AJAX.
A whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!
Would he were a Trojan!

NESTOR.
What a vice were it in Ajax now—

ULYSSES.
If he were proud.

DIOMEDES.
Or covetous of praise.

ULYSSES.
Ay, or surly borne.

DIOMEDES.
Or strange, or self-affected.
