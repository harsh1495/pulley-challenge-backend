The eye of majesty.

 Re-enter Pandarus with Cressida.

PANDARUS.
Come, come, what need you blush? Shame's a baby. Here she is now; swear
the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.—What, are you gone
again? You must be watch'd ere you be made tame, must you? Come your
ways, come your ways; and you draw backward, we'll put you i' th'
fills. Why do you not speak to her? Come, draw this curtain and let's
see your picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight!
And 'twere dark, you'd close sooner. So, so; rub on, and kiss the
mistress. How now, a kiss in fee-farm! Build there, carpenter; the air
is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you. The
falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks i' th' river. Go to, go to.

TROILUS.
You have bereft me of all words, lady.

PANDARUS.
Words pay no debts, give her deeds; but she'll bereave you o' th' deeds
too, if she call your activity in question. What, billing again? Here's
'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably.' Come in, come in;
I'll go get a fire.
