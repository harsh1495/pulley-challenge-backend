I did by imitation.

PALAMON.
More by vertue;
You are modest, Cosen.

ARCITE.
When I saw you charge first,
Me thought I heard a dreadfull clap of Thunder
Breake from the Troope.

ARCITE.
Take my Sword, I hold it better.

PALAMON.

 severall wayes: then advance and stand.]

ARCITE.
And me my love!  Is there ought else to say?

PALAMON.

And that blood we desire to shed is mutuall;
In me, thine, and in thee, mine.  My Sword
