Poore wench, goe weepe, for whosoever wins,
Looses a noble Cosen for thy sins.  [Exeunt.]

SCENE 3.  (A room in the prison.)

[Enter Iailor, Wooer, Doctor.]

DOCTOR.
Her distraction is more at some time of the Moone, then at other some,
is it not?

IAILOR.
She is continually in a harmelesse distemper, sleepes little,
altogether without appetite, save often drinking, dreaming of another
world, and a better; and what broken peece of matter so'ere she's
about, the name Palamon lardes it, that she farces ev'ry busines
withall, fyts it to every question.—

[Enter Daughter.]

Looke where shee comes, you shall perceive her behaviour.

DAUGHTER.
I have forgot it quite; The burden on't, was DOWNE A, DOWNE A, and pend
by no worse man, then Giraldo, Emilias Schoolemaster; he's as
Fantasticall too, as ever he may goe upon's legs,—for in the next world
will Dido see Palamon, and then will she be out of love with Eneas.

DOCTOR.
What stuff's here? pore soule!
