Save what I faile in: But the point is this,

ARCITE.
I should be neere the place: hoa, Cosen Palamon.  [Enter

PALAMON.
Nor none so honest, Arcite.

ARCITE.
That's no matter,
Wee'l argue that hereafter: Come, take courage;
You shall not dye thus beastly: here, Sir, drinke;

PALAMON.
Arcite, thou mightst now poyson me.

ARCITE.
I might,
But I must feare you first: Sit downe, and, good, now

Having our ancient reputation with us,
Make talke for Fooles and Cowards.  To your health, &c.
