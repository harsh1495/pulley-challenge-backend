Or a Conjurer:
Raise me a devill now, and let him play
Quipassa o'th bels and bones.

Goe, take her,
And fluently perswade her to a peace:
Et opus exegi, quod nec Iouis ira, nec ignis.
Strike up, and leade her in.

Perswasively, and cunningly: away, boyes,  [Ex. all but

And marke your Cue.—Pallas inspire me.
