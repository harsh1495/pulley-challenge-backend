DOCTOR.

DAUGHTER.
Lords and Courtiers, that have got maids with Child, they are in this
place: they shall stand in fire up to the Nav'le, and in yce up to'th
hart, and there th'offending part burnes, and the deceaving part
freezes; in troth, a very greevous punishment, as one would thinke, for
such a Trifle; beleve me, one would marry a leaprous witch, to be rid
on't, Ile assure you.

DOCTOR.
How she continues this fancie!  Tis not an engraffed Madnesse, but a
most thicke, and profound mellencholly.

DAUGHTER.
To heare there a proud Lady, and a proud Citty wiffe, howle together! I
were a beast and il'd call it good sport: one cries, 'O this smoake!'
another, 'this fire!'  One cries, 'O, that ever I did it behind the
arras!' and then howles; th'other curses a suing fellow and her garden
house.  [Sings]  I will be true, my stars, my fate, &c.  [Exit Daugh.]
