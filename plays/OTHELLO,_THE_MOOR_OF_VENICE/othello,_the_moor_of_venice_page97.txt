OTHELLO.
Hath he said anything?

No more than he'll unswear.

OTHELLO.

IAGO.
Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.

OTHELLO.
What? What?

IAGO.

OTHELLO.

IAGO.
With her, on her, what you will.

OTHELLO.
Lie with her! lie on her!—We say lie on her when they belie her.—Lie
with her! that's fulsome. Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! To
confess, and be hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to
confess. I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such
shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake

possible?—Confess?—handkerchief?—O devil!—

My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
My lord, I say! Othello!
