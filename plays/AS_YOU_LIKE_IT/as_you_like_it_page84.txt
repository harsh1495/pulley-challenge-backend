  there shall not be one spot of love in 't. ORLANDO. I would not be
  cured, youth. ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me
  Rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me. ORLANDO. Now, by
  the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is. ROSALIND. Go with
  me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way, you shall tell me
  where in the forest you live. Will you go? ORLANDO. With all my
  heart, good youth. ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come,
  sister, will you go?

SCENE III. The forest

Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind

  TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,
    Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature
    content you?
  AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
  TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
    capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
