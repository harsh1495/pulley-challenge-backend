  ISABELLA. I have a brother is condemn'd to die;
    I do beseech you, let it be his fault,

    Mine were the very cipher of a function,
    To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
    And let go by the actor.
  ISABELLA. O just but severe law!
    I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

    To him, I say.
  ISABELLA. Must he needs die?
