sirrah, make haste:  Percy is already in the field.

[Exit.]

FALSTAFF.
What, is the King encamp’d?

WESTMORELAND.
He is, Sir John:  I fear we shall stay too long.

[Exit.]

FALSTAFF.
Well,
To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.

[Exit.]

SCENE III. The Rebel Camp near Shrewsbury.

[Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Douglas, and Vernon.]

HOTSPUR.
We’ll fight with him to-night.

WORCESTER.
It may not be.

DOUGLAS.
You give him, then, advantage.

VERNON.
Not a whit.

HOTSPUR.
Why say you so? looks he not for supply?

VERNON.
So do we.

HOTSPUR.
His is certain, ours is doubtful.

WORCESTER.
Good cousin, be advised; stir not to-night.

VERNON.
Do not, my lord.

DOUGLAS.
You do not counsel well:
You speak it out of fear and cold heart.

VERNON.
Do me no slander, Douglas:  by my life,—
And I dare well maintain it with my life,—
If well-respected honour bid me on,
I hold as little counsel with weak fear
