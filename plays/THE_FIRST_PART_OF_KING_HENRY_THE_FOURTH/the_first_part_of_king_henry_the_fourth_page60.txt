true prince.  But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money.—
[To Hostess within.]  Hostess, clap-to the doors:  watch to-night, pray
to-morrow.—Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good
fellowship come to you! What, shall we be merry? shall we have a play
extempore?

PRINCE.
Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.

FALSTAFF.
Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!

[Enter the Hostess.]

HOSTESS.
O Jesu, my lord the Prince,—

PRINCE.
How now, my lady the hostess! What say'st thou to me?

HOSTESS.
Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the Court at door would speak
with you: he says he comes from your father.

PRINCE.
Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back again
to my mother.

FALSTAFF.
What manner of man is he?

HOSTESS.
An old man.

FALSTAFF.
What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him his
answer?

PRINCE.
Pr'ythee, do, Jack.

FALSTAFF.
