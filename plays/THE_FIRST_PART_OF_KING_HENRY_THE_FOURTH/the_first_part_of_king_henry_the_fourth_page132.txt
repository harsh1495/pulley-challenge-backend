If life did ride upon a dial’s point,
Still ending at th’ arrival of an hour.
An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,
When the intent of bearing them is just.

[Enter another Messenger.]

MESSENGER.
My lord, prepare:  the King comes on apace.

HOTSPUR.
I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
For I profess not talking; only this,
Let each man do his best:  and here draw I
A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
With the best blood that I can meet withal
In the adventure of this perilous day.
Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
And by that music let us all embrace;
For, Heaven to Earth, some of us never shall
A second time do such a courtesy.

[The trumpets sound.  They embrace, and exeunt.]

SCENE III. Plain between the Camps.

[Excursions, and Parties fighting.  Alarum to the battle.
Then enter Douglas and Sir Walter Blunt, meeting.]
