POINS.
O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice.

[Comes forward with Bardolph and Peto.]

BARDOLPH.
What news?

GADSHILL.
Case ye, case ye; on with your visards:  there's money of the King's
coming down the hill; 'tis going to the King's exchequer.

FALSTAFF.
You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the King's tavern.

GADSHILL.
There's enough to make us all.

FALSTAFF.
To be hang'd.

PRINCE.
Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane; Ned
Poins and I will walk lower; if they 'scape from your
encounter, then they light on us.

PETO.
How many be there of them?

GADSHILL.
Some eight or ten.

FALSTAFF.
Zwounds, will they not rob us?

PRINCE.
What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?

FALSTAFF.
Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather; but yet no coward,
Hal.

PRINCE.
Well, we leave that to the proof.

POINS.
Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:  when thou need'st him,
there thou shalt find him. Farewell, and stand fast.
