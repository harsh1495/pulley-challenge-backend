[within.] Francis!

FRANCIS.

PRINCE.
Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or,

My lord?

PRINCE.
—wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, nott-pated,
agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue,
Spanish-pouch,—

FRANCIS.

PRINCE.

Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully:  in Barbary, sir, it
cannot come to so much.

FRANCIS.
What, sir?

POINS.
[within.] Francis!

PRINCE.

[Enter Vintner.]

VINTNER.
What, stand’st thou still, and hear’st such a calling? Look to the
