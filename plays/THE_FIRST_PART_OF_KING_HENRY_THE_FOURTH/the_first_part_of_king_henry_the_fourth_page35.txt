CHAMBERLAIN.
Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night than to
fern-seed for your walking invisible.

GADSHILL.
Give me thy hand:  thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as
I am a true man.

CHAMBERLAIN.
Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.

GADSHILL.
Go to; homo is a common name to all men. Bid the ostler bring my
gelding out of the stable. Farewell, you muddy knave.

[Exeunt.]

SCENE II. The Road by Gads-hill.

[Enter Prince Henry and Poins; Bardolph and Peto at some distance.]

POINS.
Come, shelter, shelter:  I have remov’d Falstaff’s horse, and he frets
like a gumm’d velvet.

PRINCE.
Stand close.

[They retire.]

[Enter Falstaff.]

FALSTAFF.
Poins! Poins, and be hang’d! Poins!

PRINCE.
[Coming forward.]
Peace, ye fat-kidney’d rascal! what a brawling dost thou keep!

FALSTAFF.
Where’s Poins, Hal?

PRINCE.
He is walk’d up to the top of the hill: I’ll go seek him.

[Retires.]

FALSTAFF.
