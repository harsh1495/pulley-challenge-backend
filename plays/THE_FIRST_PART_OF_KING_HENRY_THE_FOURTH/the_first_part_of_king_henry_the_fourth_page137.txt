Our duty this way lies; for God’s sake, come.

[Exeunt Lancaster and Westmoreland.]

PRINCE.
By Heaven, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;
But now I do respect thee as my soul.

KING.
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
With lustier maintenance than I did look for
Of such an ungrown warrior.

PRINCE.
O, this boy
Lends mettle to us all!

[Exit.]

[Alarums. Enter Douglas.]

DOUGLAS.
Another king! they grow like Hydra’s heads:
I am the Douglas, fatal to all those

That wear those colours on them.—What art thou,
That counterfeit’st the person of a king?

KING.
The King himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart
So many of his shadows thou hast met,
And not the very King. I have two boys
Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
But, seeing thou fall’st on me so luckily,
I will assay thee; so, defend thyself.

DOUGLAS.
I fear thou art another counterfeit;
