DOUGLAS.
A fool go with thy soul, where're it goes!
A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?

HOTSPUR.
The King hath many marching in his coats.

DOUGLAS.
Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
I'll murder all his wardrobe piece by piece,
Until I meet the King.

HOTSPUR.
Up, and away!
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.

[Exeunt.]

[Alarums. Enter Falstaff.]

FALSTAFF.
Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear the shot here; here's
no scoring but upon the pate.—Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt:
there's honour for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as molten lead,
and as heavy too:  God keep lead out of me! I need no more weight than
mine own bowels. I have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered:
there's not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and they are for
the town's end, to beg during life. But who comes here?

[Enter Prince Henry.]
