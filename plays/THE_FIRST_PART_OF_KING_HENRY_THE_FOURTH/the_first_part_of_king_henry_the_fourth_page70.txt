The sheriff and all the watch are at the door:  they are come to search
the house. Shall I let them in?

FALSTAFF.
Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit:
thou art essentially mad without seeming so.

PRINCE.
And thou a natural coward, without instinct.

FALSTAFF.
I deny your major:  if you will deny the sheriff, so; if not, let him
enter:  if I become not a cart as well as another man, a plague on my
bringing up! I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as
another.

PRINCE.
Go, hide thee behind the arras:—the rest walk, up above.  Now, my
masters, for a true face and good conscience.

FALSTAFF.
Both which I have had; but their date is out, and therefore I’ll hide
me.

PRINCE.
Call in the sheriff.—

[Exeunt all but the Prince and Poins.]

[Enter Sheriff and Carrier.]

Now, master sheriff, what’s your will with me?

SHERIFF.
First, pardon me, my lord. A hue-and-cry
Hath followed certain men unto this house.
