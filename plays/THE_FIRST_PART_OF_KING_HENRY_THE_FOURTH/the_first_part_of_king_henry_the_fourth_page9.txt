FALSTAFF.
Well, thou hast call’d her to a reckoning many a time and oft.

PRINCE.
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?

FALSTAFF.
No; I’ll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.

PRINCE.
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; and where it would
not, I have used my credit.

FALSTAFF.
Yea, and so used it, that, were it not here apparent that thou art
heir-apparent—But I pr’ythee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows
standing in England when thou art king? and resolution thus fobb’d as
it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do not thou,
when thou art king, hang a thief.

PRINCE.
No; thou shalt.

FALSTAFF.
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge.

PRINCE.
Thou judgest false already:  I mean, thou shalt have the hanging of the
thieves, and so become a rare hangman.

FALSTAFF.
Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour; as well as
waiting in the Court, I can tell you.
