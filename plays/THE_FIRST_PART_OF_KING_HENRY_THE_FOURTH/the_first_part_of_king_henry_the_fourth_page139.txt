As all the poisonous potions in the world,
And saved the treacherous labour of your son.

KING.
Make up to Clifton:  I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.

[Exit.]

[Enter Hotspur.]

HOTSPUR.
If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.

PRINCE.
Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.

HOTSPUR.
My name is Harry Percy.

PRINCE.
Why, then I see
A very valiant rebel of the name.
I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
To share with me in glory any more:
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
Nor can one England brook a double reign,
Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.

HOTSPUR.
Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
To end the one of us; and would to God
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!

PRINCE.
I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
And all the budding honours on thy crest
I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.

HOTSPUR.
I can no longer brook thy vanities.

[They fight.]

[Enter Falstaff.]
