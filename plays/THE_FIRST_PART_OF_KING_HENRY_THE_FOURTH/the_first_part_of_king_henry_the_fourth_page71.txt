PRINCE.
What men?

SHERIFF.
One of them is well known, my gracious lord,—
A gross fat man.

CARRIER.
As fat as butter.

PRINCE.
The man, I do assure you, is not here;
For I myself at this time have employ’d him.
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee,
That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
Send him to answer thee, or any man,
For any thing he shall be charged withal:
And so, let me entreat you leave the house.

SHERIFF.
I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.

PRINCE.
It may be so:  if he have robb’d these men,
He shall be answerable; and so, farewell.

SHERIFF.
Good night, my noble lord.

PRINCE.
I think it is good morrow, is it not?

SHERIFF.
Indeed, my lord, I think’t be two o’clock.

[Exit Sheriff and Carrier.]

PRINCE.
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul’s. Go, call him forth.

POINS.
Falstaff!—fast asleep behind the arras, and snorting like a horse.

PRINCE.
