PRINCE.

POINS.
Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever
turn'd back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason,
I'll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we
meet at supper: how thirty, at least, he fought with; what wards, what
blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this lies the
jest.

PRINCE.
Well, I'll go with thee:  provide us all things necessary and meet me
to-night in Eastcheap; there I'll sup. Farewell.

POINS.
Farewell, my lord.

[Exit.]

PRINCE.
I know you all, and will awhile uphold
The unyok'd humour of your idleness:
Yet herein will I imitate the Sun,
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
