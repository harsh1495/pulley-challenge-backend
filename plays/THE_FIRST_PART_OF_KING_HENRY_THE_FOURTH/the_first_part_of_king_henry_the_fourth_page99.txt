and a seal-ring of my grandfather’s.

PRINCE.
A trifle, some eight-penny matter.

HOSTESS.
So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your Grace say so; and, my
lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul-mouth’d man as he is;
and said he would cudgel you.

PRINCE.
What! he did not?

HOSTESS.
There’s neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.

FALSTAFF.
There’s no more faith in thee than in a stew’d prune; nor no more truth
in thee than in a drawn fox; and, for woman-hood, Maid Marian may be
the deputy’s wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing, go.

HOSTESS.
Say, what thing? what thing?  I am an honest man’s wife:  and, setting
thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to call me so.

FALSTAFF.
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say otherwise.

HOSTESS.
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?

FALSTAFF.
What beast!  why, an otter.

PRINCE.
An otter, Sir John, why an otter?

FALSTAFF.
Why, she’s neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to have her.
