That I shall make this northern youth exchange
His glorious deeds for my indignities.
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,

Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.

The which if I perform, and do survive,
I do beseech your Majesty, may salve
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
