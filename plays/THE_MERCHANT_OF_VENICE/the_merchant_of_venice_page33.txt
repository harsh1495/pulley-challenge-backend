my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me

GOBBO.
Master young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master Jew's?

with him.

GOBBO.
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew's?

LAUNCELET.
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning
of all on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand,
but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house.
