To find the other forth; and by adventuring both
I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof
Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
That which I owe is lost. But if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both,
Or bring your latter hazard back again,
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

To wind about my love with circumstance;
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost

That in your knowledge may by me be done,
And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.
