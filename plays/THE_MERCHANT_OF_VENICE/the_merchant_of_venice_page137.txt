 Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano and their Followers.

BASSANIO.
We should hold day with the Antipodes,
If you would walk in absence of the sun.

PORTIA.

For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
And never be Bassanio so for me.

BASSANIO.

This is the man, this is Antonio,
To whom I am so infinitely bound.

For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

ANTONIO.
