Was not that letter from fair Jessica?

LORENZO.
I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
How I shall take her from her father’s house,

It will be for his gentle daughter’s sake;

Unless she do it under this excuse,
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest;
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.

The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.—

As thou hast done with me;—What, Jessica!—
