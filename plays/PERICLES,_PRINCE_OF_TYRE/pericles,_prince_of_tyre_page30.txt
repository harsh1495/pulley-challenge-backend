And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.

ALL.
The gods of Greece protect you!
And we'll pray for you.

PERICLES.
Arise, I pray you, rise:
We do not look for reverence, but for love,
And harbourage for ourself, our ships and men.

CLEON.
The which when any shall not gratify,
Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
Till when, — the which I hope shall ne'er be seen, —
Your grace is welcome to our town and us.

PERICLES.
Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,
Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.

 [_Exeunt._]

His child, iwis, to incest bring;
