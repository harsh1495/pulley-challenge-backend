     Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:
     Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
     Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:
     Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
     Make raging battery upon shores of flint._

No visor does become black villany
So well as soft and tender flattery.
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
And bear his courses to be ordered
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
In her unholy service. Patience, then,
And think you now are all in Mytilene.

 [_Exit._]

 Enter, from the brothel, two Gentlemen.
