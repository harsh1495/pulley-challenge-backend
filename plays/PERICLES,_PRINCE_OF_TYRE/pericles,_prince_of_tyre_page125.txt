Of a beloved daughter and a wife.

LYSIMACHUS.
May we not see him?

HELICANUS.

But bootless is your sight: he will not speak

Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
Drove him to this.

LYSIMACHUS.

Sir, we have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,
Would win some words of him.

LYSIMACHUS.
’Tis well bethought.
She questionless with her sweet harmony
And other chosen attractions, would allure,
And make a battery through his deafen’d parts,
