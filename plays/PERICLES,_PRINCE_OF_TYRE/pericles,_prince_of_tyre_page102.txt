BAWD.
What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?

SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in Cleon's house.

 Enter Cleon and Dionyza.

DIONYZA.
Why, are you foolish?  Can it be undone?

CLEON.
O, Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!

DIONYZA.
I think you'll turn a child again.

CLEON.
Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
I'd give it to undo the deed. A lady,
Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
To equal any single crown o' the earth
I' the justice of compare!  O villain Leonine!
Whom thou hast poison'd too:
If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness
Becoming well thy face. What canst thou say
When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
