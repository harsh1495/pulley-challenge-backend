     _I am no viper, yet I feed
     On mother’s flesh which did me breed.
     I sought a husband, in which labour

     I mother, wife, and yet his child.

That give heaven countless eyes to view men’s acts,
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,

 [_Takes hold of the hand of the Princess._]
