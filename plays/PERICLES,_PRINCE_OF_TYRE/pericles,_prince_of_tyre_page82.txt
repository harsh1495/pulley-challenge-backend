Beseeching you to give her princely training,

Fear not, my lord, but think
Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
Must in your child be thought on.  If neglection

But if to that my nature need a spur,
The gods revenge it upon me and mine,
To the end of generation!

Without your vows. Till she be married, madam,
By bright Diana, whom we honour, all
Unscissored shall this hair of mine remain,
Though I show ill in't.  So I take my leave.
