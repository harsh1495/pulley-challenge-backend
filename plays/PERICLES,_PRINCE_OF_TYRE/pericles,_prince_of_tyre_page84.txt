It is my lord's.
That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,
Even on my groaning time; but whether there

My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
A vestal livery will I take me to,
And never more have joy.

CERIMON.
Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
Diana's temple is not distant far,
Where you may abide till your date expire.
Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
Shall there attend you.

THAISA.
My recompense is thanks, that's all;
Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.

 [_Exeunt._]
