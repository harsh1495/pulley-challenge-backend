    Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by the
    chain; but I warrant you, the women have so cried and
    shriek'd at it that it pass'd; but women, indeed, cannot
    abide 'em; they are very ill-favour'd rough things.

  SLENDER. I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.

  SLENDER. Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.
