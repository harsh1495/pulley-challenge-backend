SEBASTIAN.
Why I your purse?

ANTONIO.
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
You have desire to purchase; and your store,
I think, is not for idle markets, sir.

SEBASTIAN.
I'll be your purse-bearer, and leave you for an hour.

ANTONIO.
To th' Elephant.

SEBASTIAN.
I do remember.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE IV. Olivia's garden.

 Enter Olivia and Maria.

OLIVIA.
I have sent after him. He says he'll come;
How shall I feast him? What bestow of him?
For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
I speak too loud.—
Where's Malvolio?—He is sad and civil,
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes;
Where is Malvolio?

MARIA.
He's coming, madam:
But in very strange manner. He is sure possessed, madam.

OLIVIA.
Why, what's the matter? Does he rave?

MARIA.
