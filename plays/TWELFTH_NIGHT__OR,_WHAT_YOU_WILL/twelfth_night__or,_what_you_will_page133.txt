VIOLA.
Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
You drew your sword upon me without cause,
But I bespake you fair and hurt you not.

 Enter Sir Toby, drunk, led by the Clown.

SIR ANDREW.
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me. I think you set
nothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting, you shall

othergates than he did.

DUKE.
How now, gentleman? How is't with you?

SIR TOBY.
That's all one; 'has hurt me, and there's th' end on't. Sot, didst see
Dick Surgeon, sot?

CLOWN.
O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were set at eight i'

SIR TOBY.
Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue.
