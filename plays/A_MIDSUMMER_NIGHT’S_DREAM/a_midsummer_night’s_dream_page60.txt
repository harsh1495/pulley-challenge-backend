QUINCE.
Ninus' tomb, man! Why, you must not speak that yet. That you answer to
Pyramus. You speak all your part at once, cues, and all.—Pyramus enter!
Your cue is past; it is 'never tire.'

THISBE.
O, _As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire._

 Enter Puck and Bottom with an ass's head.

PYRAMUS.
_If I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine._

QUINCE.
O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters, fly, masters!
Help!

 [_Exeunt Clowns._]

PUCK.
I'll follow you. I'll lead you about a round,
   Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier;
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
   A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
