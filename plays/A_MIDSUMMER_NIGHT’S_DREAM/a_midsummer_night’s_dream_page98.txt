I can no further crawl, no further go;
   My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!

 [_Lies down._]

PUCK.
         On the ground
         Sleep sound.
         I'll apply
         To your eye,
       Gentle lover, remedy.

 [_Squeezing the juice on Lysander's eye._]

         When thou wak'st,
         Thou tak'st
         True delight
         In the sight
       Of thy former lady's eye.
       And the country proverb known,
       That every man should take his own,
       In your waking shall be shown:
         Jack shall have Jill;
         Nought shall go ill;
