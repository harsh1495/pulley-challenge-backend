I値l watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
The next thing then she waking looks upon
(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape)
She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
And ere I take this charm from off her sight
(As I can take it with another herb)
I値l make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here? I am invisible;
And I will overhear their conference.

DEMETRIUS.
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I値l slay, the other slayeth me.
Thou told痴t me they were stol地 into this wood,
