Tom Snout, the tinker.

SNOUT
Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE.
You, Pyramus' father; myself, Thisbe's father;
Snug, the joiner, you, the lion's part. And, I hope here is a play
fitted.

SNUG
Have you the lion's part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I
am slow of study.

QUINCE.
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.

BOTTOM.
Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man's heart
good to hear me. I will roar that I will make the Duke say 'Let him
roar again, let him roar again.'

QUINCE.
If you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the
ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.
