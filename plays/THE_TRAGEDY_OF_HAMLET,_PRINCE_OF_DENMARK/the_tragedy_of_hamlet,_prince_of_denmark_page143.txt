The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.

HAMLET.
Come on, sir.

LAERTES.
Come, my lord.

 [_They play._]

HAMLET.
One.

LAERTES.
No.

HAMLET.
Judgment.

OSRIC.
A hit, a very palpable hit.

LAERTES.
Well; again.

KING.
Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Here's to thy health.

 [_Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within._]

Give him the cup.

HAMLET.
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.

 [_They play._]

Come. Another hit; what say you?


LAERTES.
A touch, a touch, I do confess.

KING.
Our son shall win.

QUEEN.
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

HAMLET.
Good madam.

KING.
Gertrude, do not drink.

QUEEN.
I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.

KING.
[_Aside._] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.

HAMLET.
I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.

QUEEN.
Come, let me wipe thy face.

LAERTES.
My lord, I'll hit him now.

KING.
I do not think't.

LAERTES.
[_Aside._] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.

HAMLET.
Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.
