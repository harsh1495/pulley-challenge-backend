LAERTES.
Ay, my lord;
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.

KING.
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
No more to undertake it, I will work him

But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
And call it accident.

And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
Of the unworthiest siege.

LAERTES.

Importing health and graveness. Two months since
Here was a gentleman of Normandy,—
I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
And they can well on horseback, but this gallant
Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
