     As if I had never been such.

 [_Throws up a skull._]

HAMLET.
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls
it to th' ground, as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that did the first
murder! This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now
o'er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?

HORATIO.
It might, my lord.

HAMLET.
Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost
thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my
lord such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?

HORATIO.
Ay, my lord.

HAMLET.
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked about the
mazard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution, an we had the
trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play
at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think on't.

FIRST CLOWN.
[_Sings._]
   A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
     For and a shrouding-sheet;
   O, a pit of clay for to be made
     For such a guest is meet.

 [_Throws up another skull._]

HAMLET.
There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be
his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks?
