For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage,
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

 [_A dead march._]

 [_Exeunt, bearing off the bodies, after which a peal of ordnance is
 shot off._]
