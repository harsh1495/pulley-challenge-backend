her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her
up, and declines his head upon her neck. Lays him down upon a bank of
flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow,
takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the King痴 ears, and
exits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate
action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,
seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner
woos the Queen with gifts. She seems loth and unwilling awhile, but in
the end accepts his love._

OPHELIA.
What means this, my lord?

HAMLET.
Marry, this is miching mallicho; it means mischief.

OPHELIA.
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

 Enter Prologue.

HAMLET.
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they値l
tell all.

OPHELIA.
Will they tell us what this show meant?

HAMLET.
Ay, or any show that you値l show him. Be not you ashamed to show, he値l
not shame to tell you what it means.

OPHELIA.
You are naught, you are naught: I値l mark the play.

PROLOGUE.
   _For us, and for our tragedy,
   Here stooping to your clemency,
   We beg your hearing patiently._
