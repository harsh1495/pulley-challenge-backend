                       Enter a troop of citizens

  MENENIUS. Here comes the clusters.
    And is Aufidius with him? You are they
    That made the air unwholesome when you cast
    Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at

  SICINIUS. Go, masters, get you be not dismay'd;
    These are a side that would be glad to have
