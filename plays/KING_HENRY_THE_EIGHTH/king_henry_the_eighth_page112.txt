    For fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience.

                 THE VISION.

      Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six PERSONAGES clad
      in white robes, wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and
      golden vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in their
      hands. They first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain

      which the other four make reverent curtsies. Then the two that
      held the garland deliver the same to the other next two, who
      observe the same order in their changes, and holding the garland
