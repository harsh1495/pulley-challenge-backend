  NORFOLK. I am sorry
    To hear this of him, and could wish he were

       Enter BRANDON, a SERGEANT-AT-ARMS before him,
              and two or three of the guard

  BRANDON. Your office, sergeant: execute it.

  BRANDON. I am sorry
    To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on

    You shall to th' Tower.
